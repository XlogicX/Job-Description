Job Description


What is This?
===============
"InfoSec" people are funny, and so are the generic titles and company names they work for. This dumb .js was inspired by Lenny Zeltsers' website:
http://zeltser.com/security-titles/

His website did job titles, so I "stole" his word-list and re-implemented.

Regarding the wordlist for company names, I chose cliche words for the first word and then harvested suffixes from the defcon 22 speakers list (http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-22/dc-22-speakers.html)...
